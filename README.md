# Masked Morse

![Masked Morse Image](Assets/previewImage.png)

My third modded module for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Masked Morse. Masked Morse is a defuser-heavy module where three Morse characters are being transmitted marquee-style in a 6x6 grid and must be extracted using RGB combination to determine three correct grid presses.

Sound effects from Hell Of A Life by Kanye West.

Special thanks to diffuse for coming up with the module's base concept.
